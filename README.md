# Names-Explorer
The Name Explorer project is a data-driven application that allows users to explore baby name statistics by year, starting from 1970 onward. The application provides insights into naming trends by showing how many times a specific name was given to babies in a selected year, as well as displaying the most popular names for that year.

Users can search for individual names to view their popularity over time or browse yearly rankings to discover the most commonly chosen baby names. The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy to navigate large datasets and interpret results.

From a technical standpoint, the project demonstrates data querying, filtering, and aggregation, along with dynamic data display based on user input. It highlights the ability to work with structured datasets and build an application that transforms raw data into meaningful insights about long-term naming trends.

# 📍 The Process
The development process of the Name Explorer project started with identifying the key requirements, including searching names by year and displaying popularity rankings from 1970 onward. A structured dataset of baby name records was prepared and optimized for efficient querying. The application logic was then implemented to filter, aggregate, and rank name data based on user input. Finally, a clean and intuitive user interface was developed to present results clearly, followed by testing and refinements to ensure accuracy, performance, and usability.
